# README

Welcome! This project is an application to create, update, organize, and study flashcards. It's a combination of a Rails API backend and a Javascript frontend. 



## Installation/Usage

Fairly straightforward this time around:

1. `cd flashcard-backend` to get to the Rails side
2. `rails db:create` to create your databases
3. `rails db:migrate` and `rails db:seed` to populate the database
4. `rails s` to start up your server

Now you're ready to start making requests to the API! Just hop over to `flashcard-frontend` and open up `index.html` in your favorite browser to play around
